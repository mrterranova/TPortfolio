        <div id="aboutMe">
            Always engaged in learning, it was only natural to turn this pursuit towards the realm of technology.
            Creativity and innovation are my life. I thrive in environments that require individuals to seek an increase
            of knowledge and compound on their abilities to learn. My previous fields in science and animation elborate
            my want to incorporate all corners of learning into a cohessive expression.
            <br>
            <br>
            My love for technology had begun as early as five with my first Windows computer. I would spend much of my
            time attempting to comprehend how to install games, explore encyclopedias, and eventually be allowed the
            opportunity to be loosed on the World Wide Web. During childhood my inquisitiveness took over and I had
            gained the ability to reboot computers, tear apart the phone leading it once again being operational, and
            ultimately become the "technology savy" ten year old in the house. My highschool years were filled with
            optimizing my web browsing skills. It is here that insight to research became my primary focus. This lasted
            throughout my college years with an emphasis on learning new software. Eventually, I entered into the
            Master's program at Savannah College of Art and Design in the field of animation. This was the true testing
            grounds to the amount of software I would need to know and the most exposed to technology I ever had.
            <br>
            <br>
            It wasn't until last year did I eventually become introduced to the field of engineering. I have always
            enjoyed numbers, but was not a pure mathmatician as I enjoyed numbers for purpose. I was encouraged to
            continue growing and understanding, which lead to my attending Georgia Tech bootcamp for coding, where I can
            incorporate a mathematical, scientific, and artistic mind into one single field.
